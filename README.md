This dataset(6000+ entries) is a subset of the original Chicago City Portal dataset (over 6m entries) 
and reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim)
that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police 
Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system.
